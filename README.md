# KK_ClothingStateMenu
Plugin for Koikatu! character maker that adds ability to toggle state of clothes and accessories. This makes it easy to see how clothes look when partially removed (useful for making clothes overlays) and to make partially dressed character card preview images.

Based on the original ClothingStateMenu plugin made by essu.
